Image segmentation results using different loss functions (a) TEM image of the helium voids (b) Ground truth labels done by humans (c) Colored overlap of  DefectSegNet’s pixel-wise semantic segmentation prediction (or mask) using WBCE loss function with GT; dark blue is false positive, yellow is false negative, and teal is where prediction matches with mask (d) Colored overlap of DefectSegNet’s pixel-wise semantic segmentation prediction using Distance map loss function with GT; dark blue is false positive, yellow is false negative, and teal is where prediction matches with mask (e) The overlap of DefectSegNet’s prediction masks using WBCE loss function with the TEM image (f) The overlap of DefectSegNet’s prediction masks using Distance map loss function with the TEM image.
